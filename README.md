# Real-Time Face Detection with OpenCV
https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e1d7b2cf-0f1c-43be-8595-7c04cb6c8207

This project demonstrates real-time face detection using OpenCVâ€”a popular computer vision library. By leveraging Haar cascades, we can identify faces in webcam streams or video files.

## Features

- Detects frontal faces in real time.
- Draws bounding boxes around detected faces.
- Minimal setup and easy-to-follow code.

## Prerequisites

Before running the project, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV (`pip install opencv-python`)

## Usage

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/real-time-face-detection.git
   cd real-time-face-detection
   ```

2. Run the face detection script:

   ```bash
   python face_detection.py
   ```

3. The webcam feed will open, and you'll see bounding boxes around detected faces.
